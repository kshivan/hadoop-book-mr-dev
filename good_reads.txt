Is it possible to have one Hadoop client machine point to two Hadoop clusters?

It is certainly possible but it'd be an edgenode not being managed by Ambari agent as Ambari will try to overwrite your configurations. What you can do is have multiple configuration directories and point each one of them to hdfs client. You can achieve that by exporting HADOOP_CONF_DIR global variable. I would also like to warn you that it's possible to make mistakes in such a set up as it's easy to mix up configurations and apply commands against environments you didn't intend to apply to. It's best to spin up a few lightweight nodes that you'd use for separate enironments or start using Ambari HDFS files view to interact with HDFS, that way you can have separate browser tab for each environment and complications with global variables goes away. We can discuss this further offline.
